# SuperView
Project for getting data about several entities through the use of the Yelp data set and other resources. The project will attempt to combine population statistics with data about businesses to derive meaningful relations such as why a business succeds, who are its competitors and where can it expand. This project also covers ways through which we can view this information on a map.
